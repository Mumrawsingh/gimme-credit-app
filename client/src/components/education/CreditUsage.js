            <p className='lesson'>
            Credit usage is calculated by looking at the "credit utilization ratio". It's
            a percentage that is found by dividing the total amount of credit currently being
            used by the total credit limit of all your accounts. Credit utilization looks 
            at how much available credit is being put to use and it is often used to suggest 
            how reliable a person is with non-cash funds. Using more than 30% of available credit is a 
            negative to creditors. Credit utilization accounts for 30% of your FICOÂ® Score. It's the next 
            most important factor in a credit score after payment history.
