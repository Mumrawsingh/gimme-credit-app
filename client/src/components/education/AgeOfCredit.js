                    When credit reporting companies look at your credit age, they consider three things:
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    1.How long a person's credit accounts have been open including the ages of their oldest account, 
                    newest account and an average age of all their accounts.
                    <br></br>
                    2.How long specific credit accounts have been open.
                    <br></br>
                    3.How long it has been since the account has been used.

                    Even if your accounts are young, There are still ways to improve your age of credit.

When Fico scores look at your credit age, they consider three things:
<br></br>
1.How long your credit accounts have been open including the ages of your oldest account, 
  newest account and an average age of all your accounts.
<br></br>
2.How long specific credit accounts have been open.
<br></br>
3.How long it has been since the account has been used.
<br></br>
If your accounts are young, There are still ways to improve your age of credit.
If there is someone whom you have a good relationship with that has a long established 
account, you can ask them to add you as an authorized user.
Please be advised that they should verify that this account must be in good standing before 
adding you, as an inconsistent payment history could hurt the FICO score of anyone associated, 
with the account, regardless of who the owner is.
